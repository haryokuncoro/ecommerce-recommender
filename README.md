# Product Recommendation Service

A simple **Java Spring Boot** project that recommends products using a mix of **content similarity** and **popularity**.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Content-based recommendation using **cosine similarity**
- Popularity boost based on total transactions
- REST API to get product recommendations
- Uses Flyway for database migration
- Easy to integrate with any e-commerce app

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Each product has a **feature vector** (e.g., `[0.75, 0.8, 0.3, 2, 1, 0, ...]`).

```java
double similarity = cosineSimilarity(productA, productB);
double popularity = transactionCount(product) / totalTransactions;
double finalScore = 0.7 * similarity + 0.3 * popularity;
````

The system recommends products with the **highest final scores**.
